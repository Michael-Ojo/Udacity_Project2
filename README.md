Data analysis for a Soccer database, containing datasets for soccer matches, players, and teams from several European countries from 2008 to 2016, with a focus on teams, players, and matches in the England premier league(EPL).

The dataset used was gotten from the soccer SQLite database, which comes from the Kaggle website. It contains data in form of tables for soccer matches, players, teams, and their attributes from several European countries from 2008 to 2016. This SQLite database was accessed using DB Browser to view the table and data available within the database. The Questions to be explored are based on the English Premier League(EPL) subset dataset from the database files derived from the leagues, matches, and player data present within the full data set, which will help limit the scope of analysis to situations that similar to each other i.e. playing against the same teams, pitches, and players and within the same seasons.
